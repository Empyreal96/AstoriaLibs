# AstoriaLibs
Fixed up source for "Microsoft.Arcadia" libraries used by Astoria/WConnect tools.

Currently only 1 .cs file still has errors

### Tools used
- ILSpy
- Visual Studio 2019

## Notes
- The project named "AstoriaLibsUWP" is blank, I plan to use that as a personal helper class one day
- Some syntax may be horrible, I'm still learning C#.
- Some values might benefit from proper naming, as a lot are generated from ILSpy's disassembly
