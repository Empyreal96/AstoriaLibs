# AstoriaLibsUWP
Fixed up source for "Microsoft.Arcadia" libraries used by Astoria/WConnect tools.



### Tools used
- ILSpy
- Visual Studio 2019

## Notes

- Most of `AowUser` seems unsupported in the targeted UWP.
- Currently stuck with `Microsoft.Arcadia.Debugging.AdbEngine.Mobile\SocketAcceptWork.cs`

- The project named "AstoriaLibsUWP" is blank, I plan to use that as a personal helper class one day
- Some syntax may be horrible, I'm still learning C#.
- Some values might benefit from proper naming, as a lot are generated from ILSpy's disassembly
